## What is the Independent SAGE?

‘We are following the ​science’ is the message the British public have
been hearing from government since COVID-19 mitigating measures began.
It says it is following the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for
Emergencies (SAGE). But the activities of the committee have been kept
secret and excluded from scrutiny by the public or wider scientific
community.

In response, on Monday May 4, the Independent SAGE convened as a group
of preeminent experts from the UK and around the world. The aim of the
Independent SAGE was and is to provide robust, independent advice to HM
Government with the purpose of helping the UK navigate COVID-19 whilst
minimising fatalities.

The Independent SAGE is chaired by former HM Government Chief Scientific
Advisor Sir David King and draws on a range of international and British
experts.
